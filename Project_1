# Added markdown - Jupyter

# Birth dates in the USA
# This Python code extracts the number of births on each day of the week from the
# following dataset: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births
# The data is structured as follows:
# year - Year - [0]
# month - Month - [1]
# date_of_month - Day number of the month - [2]
# day_of_week - Monday to Sunday are equivalent to 1 to 7 - [3]
# births - Number of births - [4]

# Opening the file
f = open("births.csv","r")
a = f.read()

data = a.split("\n")

all_data = []
for rows in data:
    row = rows.split(",")
    all_data.append(row)

# Getting rid of the first line (header)
no_header_data = all_data[1:len(all_data)]

# Creating and empty dictionary that will gather number of births per day of the week
dictionary = {}
 
for item in no_header_data:
    day_of_week = item[3]
    birth = item[4]
    births = int(birth) # Essential step as the data in no_header_data is stored as strings
    if day_of_week in dictionary:
        dictionary[day_of_week] = dictionary[day_of_week] + births
    else:
        dictionary[day_of_week] = births

# Returns the final results of day of week and total number of births
dictionary
